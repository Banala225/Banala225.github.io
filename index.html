                    <p class="list-group-item-text">All of us here at Elta are hoping that this email reaches you well and we are delighted to inform you that HMRC has now released the below information regarding the claim for Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme.</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">If we act for you on all PAYE matters, we will be able to make this claim on your behalf.  If you are unsure, complete your own payroll or need help please send an email to <a href="mailto:payrollsupport@e-lta.com">payrollsupport@e-lta.com</a> and if necessary we will make the changes necessary so that we can provide this service to you. </p>
                      <hr>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">We need your help in this important work. Your influence and your reach across the business sector are instrumental in helping us ensure employers know what they can do to get ready to make their claim. Claims should not be made by phone, it will be an online service.</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text font-weight-bold">The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS) </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">In response to the coronavirus pandemic, the Chancellor announced a series of measures to support businesses and their employees. One of those measures is the CJRS, that allows employers to claim 80% of the wages of staff (up to a maximum of £2,500 per employee) that they have furloughed (been put on temporary leave).</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">HMRC is working at pace to deliver the service that will allow businesses to make a claim. Businesses, and agents that are authorized to act on behalf of clients for PAYE matters, will be able to claim. However, file only agents, including Payroll Bureaus, will not be able access the service due to data protection reasons. </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text font-weight-bold">File only agents </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text  ">If you are a file only agent, we still need your support. You will need to help your clients, as you might hold information that they need to make their claim. Businesses will need the following information on each of their furloughed employees: </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text  ">•	National Insurance number </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text  ">•	Salary, National Insurance and pension contribution information that allows business to calculate the claim amount. </p>
                     <p class="list-group-item-text font-weight-bold  ">Service launch</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text  ">We are ready to launch on 20 April. This will be made public shortly, at which point we will be contacting businesses to advise them what they need to do. At this point we would welcome you also contacting your clients and offering yourselves as vital support during this process, either directly, if authorized, or indirectly if you are a file only agent. </p>
                     <p class="list-group-item-text  ">We are expecting phone demand to be beyond our capacity to offer a normal service. Therefore, the service is designed to be self-serve with guidance in place. Again, your support in helping us achieve this is called on.</p>

                    <p class="list-group-item-text">Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">We have now had updated guidance on the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme which is detailed below. </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">We have recently received further clarity with regard to the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CVJRS) which we have summarised here </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text font-weight-bold">Contents </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">1.	Who can claim? </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">2.	Employees you can claim for </p>

                    <p class="list-group-item-text">7.	After you’ve claimed </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">8.	When your employees are on furlough </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">The online service you’ll use to claim is not available yet. We expect it to be available by the end of April 2020. </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">If you cannot maintain your current workforce because your operations have been severely affected by coronavirus (COVID-19), you can furlough employees and apply for a grant that covers 80% of their usual monthly wage costs, up to £2,500 a month, plus the associated Employer National Insurance contributions and minimum automatic enrolment employer pension contributions on that wage. </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">This is a temporary scheme in place for 3 months starting from 1 March 2020, but it may be extended if necessary and employers can use this scheme anytime during this period. It is designed to help employers whose operations have been severely affected by coronavirus (COVID-19) to retain their employees and protect the UK economy. However, all employers are eligible to claim under the scheme and the government recognises different businesses will face different impacts from coronavirus. </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text font-weight-bold">1)	Who can claim? </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">You must have: </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">•	Created and started a PAYE payroll scheme on or before 28 February 2020 </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">•	Enrolled for PAYE online - this can take up to 10 days </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">•	A UK bank account</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">Any entity with a UK payroll can apply, including businesses, charities, recruitment agencies and public authorities. </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text font-weight-bold">Apprentices </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">Apprentices can be furloughed in the same way as other employees and they can continue to train whilst furloughed. </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">However, you must pay your Apprentices at least the Apprenticeship Minimum Wage, National Living Wage or National Minimum Wage (AMW/NLW/NMW) as appropriate for all the time they spend training. This means you must cover any shortfall between the amount you can claim for their wages through this scheme and their appropriate minimum wage. </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">Guidance is available for changes in apprenticeship learning <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-apprenticeship-programme-response/coronavirus-covid-19-guidance-for-apprentices-employers-training-providers-end-point-assessment-organisations-and-external-quality-assurance-pro" target="_blank">arrangements because of COVID-19.</a> </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text font-weight-bold">2)	Employees you can claim for </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">You can only claim for furloughed employees that were on your PAYE payroll on or before 28 February 2020. </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">Employees hired after 28 February 2020 cannot be furloughed and claimed for in accordance with this scheme. </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">Employees can be on any type of employment contract, including full-time, part-time, agency, flexible or zero-hour contracts. Foreign nationals are eligible to be furloughed. </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">To be eligible for the grant, when on furlough, an employee cannot undertake work for, or on behalf, of the organisation. This includes providing services or generating revenue. Employers are free to consider allocating any critical business tasks to staff that are not furloughed. While on furlough, the employee’s wage will be subject to usual income tax and other deductions. </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text font-weight-bold">If you made employees redundant or they stopped working for you after 28 February </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">If you made employees redundant, or they stopped working for you on or after 28 February 2020, you can re-employ them, put them on furlough and claim for their wages through the scheme. </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text font-weight-bold">If your employees are working reduced hours </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">If an employee is working, but on reduced hours, or for reduced pay, they will not be eligible for this scheme. </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text font-weight-bold">If your employee is on unpaid leave </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">You can only claim for employees that started unpaid leave after 28 February 2020.</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">If your employee is self-isolating or on sick leave </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">If you’re employee is on sick leave or self-isolating, they’ll be able to get <a href="https://www.gov.uk/statutory-sick-pay" target="_blank">Statutory Sick Pay.</a> </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">You cannot claim for employees while they’re getting Statutory Sick Pay, but they can be furloughed and claimed for once they are no longer receiving <a href="https://www.gov.uk/statutory-sick-pay" target="_blank">Statutory Sick Pay.</a> </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">You cannot claim for employees while they’re getting Statutory Sick Pay, but they can be furloughed and claimed for once they are no longer receiving Statutory Sick Pay.</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text font-weight-bold">Shielding Employees </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">You can claim for furloughed employees who are <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19#what-is-shielding" target="_blank">shielding in line with public health guidance</a> (or need to stay home with someone who is shielding) if they are unable to work from home and you would otherwise have to make them redundant. </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text font-weight-bold">Employees with caring responsibilities </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text ">Employees who are unable to work because they have caring responsibilities resulting from coronavirus (COVID-19) can be furloughed. For example, employees that need to look after children can be furloughed. </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text font-weight-bold">If your employee has more than one job </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">If your employee has more than one employer, they can be furloughed for each job. Each job is separate, and the cap applies to each employer individually. </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">Employees can be furloughed in one job and receive a furloughed payment but continue working for another employer and receive their normal wages. </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text font-weight-bold">If your employee is on a fixed term contract </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">Employees on fixed term contracts can be furloughed. Their contracts can be renewed or extended during the furlough period without breaking the terms of the scheme. Where a fixed term employee’s contract ends because it is not extended or renewed you will no longer be able claim grant for them. </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text font-weight-bold">Eligible individuals who are not employees</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">As well as employees, the grant can be claimed for any of the following groups, if they are paid via PAYE: </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">•	Office holders (including company directors) </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">•	Salaried members of Limited Liability Partnerships (LLPs) </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">•	Agency workers (including those employed by umbrella companies) </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">•	Limb (b) workers </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">The guidance below sets out specific considerations for those individuals who are paid via PAYE, but who are not necessarily employees in employment law. Unless explicitly set out below, all other guidance is applicable to these cases, and should be followed. </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text font-weight-bold">Company Directors </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">As office holders, salaried company directors are eligible to be furloughed and receive support through this scheme. Company directors owe duties to their company which are set out in the Companies Act 2006. Where a company (acting through its board of directors) considers that it is in compliance with the statutory duties of one or more of its individual salaried directors, the board can decide that such directors should be furloughed. Where one or more individual directors’ furlough is so decided by the board, this should be formally adopted as a decision of the company, noted in the company records and communicated in writing to the director(s) concerned. </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">Where furloughed directors need to carry out particular duties to fulfil the statutory obligations they owe to their company, they may do so provided they do no more than would reasonably be judged necessary for that purpose, for instance, they should not do work of a kind they would carry out in normal circumstances to generate commercial revenue or provides services to or on behalf of their company. </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">This also applies to salaried individuals who are directors of their own personal service company (PSC). </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text font-weight-bold">Salaried Members of Limited Liability Partnerships (LLPs) </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">Members of LLPs who are designated as employees for tax purposes (‘salaried members’) under the Income Tax (Trading and Other Income) Act (ITTOIA) 2005 are eligible to be furloughed and receive support through this scheme. </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">The rights and duties of a member of an LLP are set out in an LLP agreement and in the absence of an agreement, default provisions in the LLP Act 2000, based upon company and partnership law. Such an agreement may include separate agreement between the LLP and an individual member setting out the terms applicable to that member’s relationship with the LLP. </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">To furlough a member, the terms of the LLP agreement (or any such agreement between the LLP and the member) may need to be varied by a formal decision of the LLP, for example to reflect the fact that the member will perform no work in the LLP for the period of furlough, and the effect of this on their remuneration from the LLP. For an LLP member who is treated as being employed by the LLP (in accordance with s863A of ITTOIA 2005), the reference salary for this scheme is the LLP member’s profit allocation, excluding any amounts which are determined by the LLP member’s performance, or the overall performance of the LLP. </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text font-weight-bold">Agency Workers (including those employed by umbrella companies)</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">Where agency workers are paid through PAYE, they are eligible to be furloughed and receive support through this scheme, including where they are employed by umbrella companies. </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">Furlough should be agreed between the agency, as the deemed employer, and the worker, though it would be advised to discuss the need to furlough with any end clients involved. As with employees, agency workers should perform no work for, through or on behalf of the agency that has furloughed them while they are furloughed, including for the agency’s clients. </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">Where an agency supplies clients with workers who are employed by an umbrella company that operates the PAYE, it will be for the umbrella company and the worker to agree whether to furlough the worker or not. </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">If your employee does volunteer work </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">A furloughed employee can take part in volunteer work, if it does not provide services to or generate revenue for, or on behalf of your organisation. Your organisation can agree to find furloughed employees new work or volunteering opportunities whilst on furlough if this is in line with public health guidance.</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text font-weight-bold">If your employee undertakes training </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">Furloughed employees can engage in training, as long as in undertaking the training the employee does not provide services to, or generate revenue for, or on behalf of their organisation. Furloughed employees should be encouraged to undertake training. </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">Where training is undertaken by furloughed employees, at the request of their employer, they are entitled to be paid at least their appropriate national minimum wage for this time. In most cases, the furlough payment of 80% of an employee’s regular wage, up to the value of £2,500, will provide sufficient monies to cover these training hours. However, where the time spent training attracts a minimum wage entitlement in excess of the furlough payment, employers will need to pay the additional wages (see National Minimum Wage Section for more details). </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text font-weight-bold">If your employee is on maternity leave, adoption leave, paternity leave or shared parental leave </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">The normal <a href="https://www.gov.uk/maternity-pay-leave" target="_blank">rules for maternity and other forms of parental leave and pay</a> apply. </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">You can claim through the scheme for enhanced (earnings related) contractual pay for employees who qualify for either:</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">•	Maternity pay</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">•	Adoption pay</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">•	Paternity pay</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">•	Shared parental pay</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text font-weight-bold ">3)	Agreeing to furlough employees </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">Employers should discuss with their staff and make any changes to the employment contract by agreement. When employers are making decisions in relation to the process, including deciding who to offer furlough to, equality and discrimination laws will apply in the usual way. </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">To be eligible for the grant employers must confirm in writing to their employee confirming that they have been furloughed. A record of this communication must be kept for five years. </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">You do not need to place all your employees on furlough. However, those employees who you do place on furlough cannot undertake work for you. </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text font-weight-bold">4)	How much you can claim </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">You’ll need to claim for: </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">•	80% of your employees’ wages (even for employee’s on National Minimum Wage) - up to a maximum of £2,500. Do not claim for the worker’s previous salary. </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">•	minimum automatic enrolment employer pension contributions on the subsidised wage </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">You can choose to top up your employee’s salary, but you do not have to. Employees must not work or provide any services for the business while furloughed, even if they receive a top-up salary. </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">Grants will be prorated if your employee is only furloughed for part of a pay period. </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">Claims should be started from the date that the employee finishes work and starts furlough, not when the decision is made, or when they written to confirming their furloughed status. </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">The way you work out your employees’ wages is different depending on what type of contract they’re on, and when they started work. </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text font-weight-bold">Full or part time employees on a salary </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text ">Claim for the 80% of the employee’s salary, as of 28 February 2020, before tax. </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text font-weight-bold">Employees whose pay varies </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">If the employee has been employed for 12 months or more, you can claim the highest of either the: </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">•	same month’s earning from the previous year </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">•	average monthly earnings for the 2019-2020 tax year </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">If the employee has been employed for less than 12 months, claim for 80% of their average monthly earnings since they started work. </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">If the employee only started in February 2020, work out a pro-rata for their earnings so far, and claim for 80%. </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text font-weight-bold">Employer National Insurance and Pension Contributions </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">You’ll still need to pay employer National Insurance and pension contributions on behalf of your furloughed employees, and you can claim for these too. </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">You cannot claim for: </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">•	Additional National Insurance or pension contributions you make because you chose to top up your employee’s salary</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">•	Any pension contributions you make that are above the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/workplace-pensions/what-you-your-employer-and-the-government-pay"  target="_blank"> mandatory employer contribution </a> </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text font-weight-bold">Past Overtime, Fees, Commission, Bonuses and non-cash payments </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">You can claim for any regular payments you are obliged to pay your employees. This includes wages, past overtime, fees and compulsory commission payments. However, discretionary bonus (including tips) and commission payments and non-cash payments should be excluded. </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">Benefits in Kind and Salary Sacrifice Schemes </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">The reference salary should not include the cost of non-monetary benefits provided to employees, including taxable Benefits in Kind. Similarly, benefits provided through salary </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">We have now had updated guidance on the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme which is detailed below. </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">sacrifice schemes (including pension contributions) that reduce an employee’s taxable pay should also not be included in the reference salary. Where the employer provides benefits to furloughed employees, this should be in addition to the wages that must be paid under the terms of the Job Retention Scheme. </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">Normally, an employee cannot switch freely out of a salary sacrifice scheme unless there is a life event. HMRC agrees that COVID-19 counts as a life event that could warrant changes to salary sacrifice arrangements, if the relevant employment contract is updated accordingly. </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text font-weight-bold">Apprenticeship Levy and Student Loans </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">Both the Apprenticeship Levy and Student Loans should continue to be paid as usual. Grants from the Job Retention Scheme do not cover these. </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text font-weight-bold">National Minimum Wage </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">Individuals are only entitled to the National Living Wage (NLW)/National Minimum Wage (NMW)/ Apprentices Minimum Wage (AMW) for the hours they are working or treated as working under minimum wage rules. </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">This means that furloughed workers who are not working can be paid the lower of 80% of their salary or £2,500 even if, based on their usual working hours, this would be below their appropriate minimum wage. However, time spent training is treated as working time for the purposes of the minimum wage calculations and must be paid at the appropriate minimum wage, taking into account the increase in minimum wage rates from 1 April 2020. As such, employers will need to ensure that the furlough payment provides sufficient monies to cover these training hours. Where the furlough payment is less than the appropriate minimum wage entitlement for the training hours, the employer will need to pay the additional wages to ensure at least the appropriate minimum wage is paid for 100% of the training time. </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">Where a furloughed worker is paid close to minimum wage levels and asked to complete training courses for a substantial majority of their usual working time employers are recommended to seek independent advice or contact ACAS. </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text font-weight-bold">5)	What you’ll need to make a claim </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">Employers should discuss with their staff and make any changes to the employment contract by agreement. Employers may need to seek legal advice on the process. If sufficient numbers of staff are involved, it may be necessary to engage collective consultation processes to procure agreement to changes to terms of employment. </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">To claim, you will need:</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">•	Your PAYE reference number </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">•	The number of employees being furloughed </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">•	The claim period (start and end date)</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">•	Amount claimed (per the minimum length of furloughing of 3 consecutive weeks) </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">•	Your bank account number and sort code </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">•	Your contact name</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">•	Your phone number </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">You will need to calculate the amount you are claiming. HMRC will retain the right to retrospectively audit all aspects of your claim. </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text font-weight-bold">6)	Claim </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">You should make your claim using the amounts in your payroll - either shortly before or during running payroll. Claims can be backdated until the 1 March where employees have already been furloughed. </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">If appropriate, worker’s wages should be reduced to 80% of their salary within your payroll before they are paid. This adjustment will not be made by HMRC. </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text font-weight-bold">Minimum furlough periods </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">Any employees you place on furlough must be furloughed for a minimum period of 3 consecutive weeks. When they return to work, they must be taken off furlough. Employees can be furloughed multiple times, but each separate instance must be for a minimum period of 3 consecutive weeks. </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text font-weight-bold">7)	After you’ve claimed </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">You must pay the employee all the grant you receive for their gross pay, no fees can be charged from the money that is granted. </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text font-weight-bold">When the government ends the scheme</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">When the government ends the scheme, you must make a decision, depending on your circumstances, as to whether employees can return to their duties. If not, it may be necessary to consider termination of employment (redundancy). </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">HMRC will process all claims made before the scheme ends. </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text font-weight-bold">8)	When your employees are on furlough </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">You cannot ask your employee to do any work that: </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">•	Makes money for your organisation </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">•	Provides services for your organisation </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">They can take part in volunteer work or training. </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text font-weight-bold">Employee taxes </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">Your employees will still pay the taxes they normally pay out of their wages. </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">This includes pension contributions (both employer contributions and automatic contributions from the employee), unless the employee has opted out or stopped saving into their pension. </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">Employee rights </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">Employees still have the same rights at work, including: </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">•	Statutory Sick Pay </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">•	Maternity and other parental rights </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">•	Rights against unfair dismissal </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">•	Redundancy payments </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">Grants cannot be used to substitute redundancy payments. HMRC will continue to monitor businesses after the scheme has closed. </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text font-weight-bold">Working for a different employer </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">If contractually allowed, your employees are permitted to work for another employer whilst you have placed them on furlough. </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text  ">For any employer that takes on a new employee, the new employer should ensure they complete the starter checklist form correctly. If the employee is furloughed from another employment, they should complete Statement C. </p>

                    <p class="list-group-item-text ">Payments received by a business under the scheme are made to offset these deductible revenue costs. They must therefore be included as income in the business’s calculation of its taxable profits for Income Tax and Corporation Tax purposes, in accordance with normal principles. </p>

                    <hr>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">We have now had updated guidance on the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme which is detailed below. </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">This is the official HMRC guidance.  There is still some uncertainty around the mechanics of how the HMRC portal will work once it is built but as your payroll provider we will be briefed as and when this is being rolled out.  Please look out for any correspondence from HMRC in the mean time. </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text"> We understand that as your payroll provider we will inform HMRC of furloughed workers through the as yet inbuilt HMRC payroll portal. </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text"> We have also included a letter which you can use to inform your employees of your intention to furlough them. </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text font-weight-bold"> Key Points </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text"> •	All staff who were on payroll as at 28th February are eligible for the scheme no matter what contract they are on</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">•	HMRC will pay 80% of salaries up to a maximum of £2,500/month. This includes all national insurance and pension contributions</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">•	Tax/National Insurance and other wage deductions are still made</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">•	Holidays accrue as normal</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">•	Employers can pay more than the grant but are not obliged to</p>

                    <p class="list-group-item-text">•	Anyone who does not wish to be furloughed can be at risk of redundancy in line with their standard contract terms and current employment law.</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">•	government to cover employer National Insurance and pension contributions of furloughed workers – on top of 80% of salary</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text">•	those furloughed can volunteer for the NHS without risking their pay </p>

                    <p class="list-group-item-text ">If you and your employer both agree, your employer might be able to keep you on the payroll if they’re unable to operate or have no work for you to do because of coronavirus (COVID-19). This is known as being ‘on furlough’. Check if you are eligible below.</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text ">You could get paid 80% of your wages through the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, up to a monthly cap of £2,500.</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text  "> You’ll still be paid at least 80% of your wages by your employer and pay taxes from your income. You cannot undertake work for your employer while on furlough. We expect the scheme to be up and running by the end of April.</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text font-weight-bold "> Check if you’re eligible</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text  ">Both you and your employer must agree to put you on furlough - so speak to your employer about whether they can claim. You cannot apply for the scheme yourself. Once agreed your employer must write to you confirming you have been furloughed to be eligible to claim.</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text  ">Any UK employer with a UK bank account will be able to claim, but you must have been on your employer’s PAYE payroll on 28 February 2020. You can be on any type of contract, including a zero-hour contract or a temporary contract.</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text  ">This scheme does not apply if you are self-employed or to any income from self-employment.</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text  "> If you’re on sick leave or self-isolating because of coronavirus (COVID-19), speak to your employer about whether you’re eligible - you should get <a href="https://www.gov.uk/statutory-sick-pay" target="_blank">Statutory Sick Pay (SSP)</a> while you are on sick leave or self-isolating, but can be furloughed after this.</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text  ">If you are shielding in line with public health guidance, then you should speak to your employer about whether they plan to place staff on furlough.</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text  ">The grant will start on the day you were placed on furlough and this can be backdated to 1 March.</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text font-weight-bold  ">If you were made redundant after 28 February</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text  "> Your employer can agree to re-employ you and place you on furlough instead. They’ll still be able to claim a grant to cover 80% of your monthly earnings, up to a monthly cap of £2,500.</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text font-weight-bold  "> If you currently have more than one employer</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text  "> You can be put on furlough by one employer and continue to work for another, if it is permitted within your employment contract.</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text  ">If you’re put on furlough by more than one employer, you’ll receive separate payments from each employer. The 80% of your normal wage up to a £2,500 monthly cap applies to each job.</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text font-weight-bold  "> If you are on Universal Credit</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text  "> If you’re earning less because you’re on furlough, your Universal Credit payment might change - <a href="https://www.gov.uk/universal-credit/how-your-earnings-affect-your-payments" target="_blank">find out how earnings affect your payments.</a></p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text font-weight-bold "> If you are on Maternity Leave, contractual adoption pay, paternity pay or shared parental pay</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text  "> You must take at least 2 weeks Maternity Leave (4 weeks if you work in a factory or workshop) immediately following the birth of your baby. This is a health and safety requirement. In practice, most women start their Maternity Leave before they give birth and you may want to do this.</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text  "> If you are eligible for Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP) or Maternity Allowance, the normal rules apply, and you will be entitled to claim up to 39 weeks of statutory pay or allowance.</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text  "> If you qualify for SMP, you will still be eligible for 90% of your average weekly earnings in the first 6 weeks, followed by 33 weeks of pay paid at 90% of your average weekly earnings or the statutory flat rate (whichever is lower). The statutory flat rate is currently £148.68 a week, rising to £151.20 a week from April 2020.</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text  "> Some employers ‘top up’ Statutory Maternity Pay and their employees are eligible for an enhanced, earnings related rate of pay. If you are eligible for enhanced (contractual) maternity pay from your employer this is included within the wage costs that your employer can claim through the scheme. The same principles apply if you qualify for contractual adoption pay, paternity pay or shared parental pay.</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text  font-weight-bold"> If you are currently pregnant and due to start Maternity Leave</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text  "> You will start Maternity Leave as usual. If your earnings have reduced due to a period on furlough or statutory sick pay prior to your Maternity Leave starting this may affect your Statutory Maternity Pay. The same principle applies to contractual adoption pay, paternity pay and shared parental pay.</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text font-weight-bold "> How much you’ll get</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text  "> Your employer will get a grant to cover 80% of your monthly earnings, up to a maximum of £2,500. Firms will be eligible for the grant once you have been furloughed, from 1 March. Your employer:</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text  "> •	Will pay you at least 80% of your usual monthly earnings, up to a maximum of £2,500, as your wage</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text  "> •	Can claim for a minimum of 3 weeks and for up to 3 months - but this may be extended</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text  "> •	Can choose to pay you more than the grant - but they do not have to</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text  "> You’ll still pay Income Tax, National Insurance contributions and any other deductions from your wage.</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text  "> If you are concerned that your employer is not paying you what you are entitled to then you should raise this with your employer in the first instance, then with ACAS (Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service).</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text  "> Businesses furloughing staff during the coronavirus outbreak will receive further financial support – with the costs of employer national insurance and pension contributions being covered by the government.</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text  "> Under the scheme, employers can claim a grant covering 80% of the wages for a furloughed employee, subject to a cap of £2,500 a month.</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text  ">In a move that could save businesses an extra £300 a month for each employee under the scheme, the government will now cover the employer national insurance and minimum auto-enrolment pension scheme contributions employers pay on the wages they must pay their furloughed staff – on top of the wages covered under the scheme.</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text font-weight-bold ">How your monthly earnings are calculatede</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text  "> If you’ve been employed (or engaged by an employment business in the case of agency workers) for a full year, employers will claim for the higher of either:</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text  "> •	The amount you earned in the same month last year</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text  "> •	An average of your monthly earnings from the last year</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text  "> If you’ve been employed for less than a year, employers will claim for an average of your monthly earnings since you started work. The same arrangements apply if your monthly pay varies such as if you are on a zero-hour contract.</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text  ">If you started work in February 2020, your employer will pro-rata your earnings from that month.</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text  "> Bonuses, commissions and fees are not included as part of your monthly earnings.</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text font-weight-bold "> While you’re on furlough</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text  ">Your employer will need to notify you before putting you on furlough.</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text  "> Once you are on furlough you will not be able to work for your employer, but you can undertake training or volunteer subject to public health guidance, as long as you’re not:</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text  "> •	Making money for your employer</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text  "> •	Providing services to your employer</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text  "> If workers are required to for example, complete training courses whilst they are furloughed, then they must be paid at least the NLW/NMW for the time spent training, even if this is more than the 80% of their wage that will be subsidised.</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text  ">Any activities undertaken while on furlough must be in line with the latest Public Health guidance during the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text  ">Your employer can still make you redundant while you’re on furlough or afterwards.</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text  "> Your rights as an employee are not affected by being on furlough, including <a href="https://www.gov.uk/redundancy-your-rights" target="_blank">redundancy rights</a>.</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text  "> If your employer chooses to place you on furlough, you will need to remain on furlough for a minimum of 3 weeks. However, your employer can place you on furlough more than once, and one period can follow straight after an existing furlough period, while the scheme is open. The scheme will be open for at least 3 months.</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text  ">Those on furlough will also be permitted to volunteer without risking their pay - and will be able to join the 500,000 members of the public who have signed up to help the NHS during the coronavirus outbreak.</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text  font-weight-bold">If you do not want to go on furlough</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text  ">If your employer asks you to go on furlough and you refuse you may be at risk of redundancy or termination of employment, depending on the circumstances of your employer. However, this must be in line with normal redundancy rules and protections.</p>

                    <p class="list-group-item-text  font-weight-bold   ">Support for businesses through the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text    ">A new temporary Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme, delivered by the British Business Bank, will launch early next week to support primarily small and medium-sized businesses to access bank lending and overdrafts. </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text    ">The government will provide lenders with a guarantee of 80% on each loan (subject to a per-lender cap on claims) to give lenders further confidence in continuing to provide finance to SMEs. The government will not charge businesses or banks for this guarantee, and the Scheme will support loans of up to £5 million in value. </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text font-weight-bold ">Eligibility </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text   ">You are eligible if:</p>

There are 40 accredited providers in all. </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text   ">You should talk to your bank or finance provider (not the British Business Bank) as soon as possible and discuss your business plan with them. This will help your finance provider to act quickly once the Scheme has launched. If you have an existing loan with monthly repayments, you may want to ask for a repayment holiday to help with cash flow. </p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text    ">The scheme will be available from early next week commencing 23 March. </p>

                    <p class="list-group-item-text   ">Businesses that have cover for both pandemics and government-ordered closure should be covered, as the government and insurance industry confirmed on 17 March 2020 that advice to avoid pubs, theatres etc. is sufficient to make a claim as long as all other terms and conditions are met.</p>
                    <p class="list-group-item-text    ">Insurance policies differ significantly, so businesses are encouraged to check the terms and conditions of their specific policy and contact their providers. Most businesses are unlikely to be covered, as standard business interruption insurance policies are dependent on damage to property and will exclude pandemics. </p>
